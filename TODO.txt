FRONTEND: 
- Paypal integration: 
  - TODO: Create a successful payment page with order refresh
  - Create a payment failed operation, or return to basket with payment failed message
  - Integrate checkout option to call the checkout route and then take the user to the checkout page
- Add an available stock field to the items in the basket so that stock can be validated
- The checkout route should validate the stock, and return the amount that needs to be reduced in basket if not enough
- When a stock error is returned from the createOrder route, the frontend should re-call checkout and update the stock in the basket
- Add same add to basket timeout as in basket on product page
- create order success page
- Login should go back a page if remains on the same page
  

BACKEND:
  - Write route for creating an order
  - Write route for capturing the order
  - Write in checks to createOrder to ensure that there are no duplicate ids, as this can cause write errors in the mongoose session. Same as checkout for errors
  - Change checkout route to not only validate the stock and the product ids, but send back the quantity of the stock that is missing so that the information can be used frontend
  - Write functionality for aborting checkout to release stock
  - Add timeout to tempOrder that expires after an hour? 
  - Add functionality to onApprove method to release stock if order not created? currently left to frontend to call release endpoint
  - Figure way of storing images more cleanly
   - file uploads through express?
   - plug images into orders and checkout?

TODOS:

- Simple stock validation for checkout
  - Check that there is enough stock for items when user attempts to checkout
  - Checkout consists of just a get call to checkout route, where confirmation info is returned before proceeding
  - If there is not enough stock, return error to frontend
   - Decide: should frontend remove from basket? 
   - Should there be known 'out of stock' flag on items in basket in frontend?
- Implement the soft reservation system
  - Info notification in case adding to basket does not succeed, and change to the stock level of product in FE
  - Warning for low stock items, and message that stock will be reserved for x minutes
  - Decide: How to manage stock reservations for multiple items?
  - Updated route for adding to basket, that creates reservations when ls
  - Background tasks for removing reservations
  - Web sockets for notifying users that an item in their basket is out of stock
 

Later
- Add database sharding for category
- Add an index for user of orders
- Add an index for user id of baskets
- Implememt refresh tokens so that frontend requests a fresh access token if expired.
   - somehow do this without user knowledge
- Implement routine that cleans up expired tempOrders that have not been handled correctly
- Change stock reservation cleanup to non-atomic using bulkwrite. 
 - Reservation updates that throw error are passed to task queue to be dealt with instead of whole op failing
- Add indexing to orderNumber, as generateOrderNumber() searches for documents in this field on each createOrder
