BACKEND:

TODOS:
- Create MVP for basket, ie simple route that adds item to basket if there is stock available
  - Add adding to basket route
  - Add incrementing or decrementing basket quantity route
- Simple stock validation for checkout
  - Check that there is enough stock for items when user attempts to checkout
  - Checkout consists of just a get call to checkout route, where confirmation info is returned before proceeding
  - If there is not enough stock, return error to frontend
   - Decide: should frontend remove from basket? 
   - Should there be known 'out of stock' flag on items in basket in frontend?
- Implement the soft reservation system
  - Decide: How to manage stock reservations for multiple items?
  - Updated route for adding to basket, that creates reservations when ls
  - Background tasks for removing reservations
  - Web sockets for notifying users that an item in their basket is out of stock
 

Later
- Add database sharding for category
- Add an index for user of orders
