FRONTEND: 
  - Create logout mechanism for token expired events on all pages
  

BACKEND:
  - 

TODOS:
- Create MVP for basket, ie simple route that adds item to basket if there is stock available

  -- THINK: IVE REMOVED THE ID FROM THE PRODUCTS IN THE ARRAY, BUT DO I ACTUALLY WANT THESE FOR BASKET MANIPUTAION?
- Simple stock validation for checkout
  - Check that there is enough stock for items when user attempts to checkout
  - Checkout consists of just a get call to checkout route, where confirmation info is returned before proceeding
  - If there is not enough stock, return error to frontend
   - Decide: should frontend remove from basket? 
   - Should there be known 'out of stock' flag on items in basket in frontend?
- Implement the soft reservation system
  - Info notification in case adding to basket does not succeed, and change to the stock level of product in FE
  - Warning for low stock items, and message that stock will be reserved for x minutes
  - Decide: How to manage stock reservations for multiple items?
  - Updated route for adding to basket, that creates reservations when ls
  - Background tasks for removing reservations
  - Web sockets for notifying users that an item in their basket is out of stock
 

Later
- Add database sharding for category
- Add an index for user of orders
- Add an index for user id of baskets
